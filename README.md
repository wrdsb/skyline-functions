# Skyline Functions
Azure Functions app for our log collector, Skyline. 

## Colophon
In commercial logging operations utilizing a skyline, harvested logs are 
transported on a suspended steel cable, a cableway or "highline", from various 
locations where the trees are felled to a central location.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline_logging.

Skyline performs an analogous function, collecting and aggregating logs (or individual
events) from where they are generated by various applications to a central location.
